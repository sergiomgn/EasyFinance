# Git Commit Strategy for EasyFinance CI/CD Pipeline

This document outlines the recommended git commits for the CI/CD pipeline implementation.
Each commit follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

## Commit Sequence

Execute these commits in order to maintain a clean git history:

### 1. Project Configuration Setup
```bash
git add pyproject.toml pytest.ini
git commit -m "feat: add project configuration with pyproject.toml and pytest.ini

- Add comprehensive pyproject.toml with build system, project metadata, and tool configurations
- Configure Black (88 char line length), isort (black profile), pytest, coverage, mypy, pylint, bandit

```

### 5. Additional GitHub Actions Workflows
```bash
git add .github/workflows/pre-commit.yml .github/workflows/codeql.yml .github/workflows/release.yml
git commit -m "feat: add specialized GitHub Actions workflows

- Add pre-commit workflow for automated hook validation
- Implement CodeQL workflow for advanced security analysis with weekly schedule
- Add release workflow for automated releases on version tags
- Configure PyPI publishing with PYPI_API_TOKEN secret
- Add Docker Hub publishing with automated image tagging

```

### 6. GitHub Issue and PR Templates
```bash
git add .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ .github/pull_request_template.md
git commit -m "feat: add comprehensive GitHub issue and PR templates

- Add bug report template with environment info and reproduction steps
- Add feature request template with use cases and acceptance criteria
- Add security vulnerability template with severity assessment
- Add detailed PR template with type classification and review checklist
- Include testing, security, performance, and compatibility sections
- Add post-merge tasks and reviewer guidelines"
```

### 7. Updated Dependencies
```bash
git add src/requirements.txt src/requirements-dev.txt tests/requirements-test.txt
git commit -m "feat: update project dependencies for CI/CD pipeline

- Upgrade src/requirements.txt with FastAPI, Pydantic, JWT, BCrypt, uvicorn
- Enhance src/requirements-dev.txt with linting and formatting tools
- Add tests/requirements-test.txt with pytest, coverage, and testing utilities
- Pin minimum versions while allowing patch updates
- Include all dependencies needed for comprehensive CI/CD pipeline"
```

### 8. Test Infrastructure Enhancement
```bash
git add tests/run_tests.py tests/test_utils.py
git commit -m "feat: enhance test infrastructure with utilities and runner

- Add custom test runner using unittest for dependency-free testing
- Create comprehensive test utilities with TestDataFactory, DatabaseTestHelper
- Add TokenTestHelper for JWT testing scenarios
- Include ValidationHelper for common assertions
- Add TempDatabaseContext for isolated database testing
- Provide fallback testing solution for environments with dependency conflicts"
```

### 9. Documentation
```bash
git add .github/CICD.md CICD_README.md SETUP_COMPLETE.md
git commit -m "docs: add comprehensive CI/CD documentation

- Add .github/CICD.md with technical pipeline documentation
- Create CICD_README.md with user-friendly setup guide and workflow explanations
- Add SETUP_COMPLETE.md with step-by-step completion instructions
- Include troubleshooting guides, environment setup, and best practices
- Document all make targets, workflow triggers, and quality gates
- Provide migration guides and future enhancement roadmap"
```

## Alternative: Single Comprehensive Commit

If you prefer a single commit for the entire CI/CD setup:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

BREAKING CHANGE: Major CI/CD infrastructure addition

- Add GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD, pre-commit, CodeQL, and releases
- Implement comprehensive code quality gates with linting, formatting, and security scanning
- Add multi-version testing across Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 with 80% coverage requirement
- Configure automated deployments to staging (develop) and production (main)
- Add automated release process with PyPI and Docker Hub publishing
- Enhance pre-commit configuration with comprehensive hooks
- Add project configuration with pyproject.toml and tool settings
- Create comprehensive Makefile with 50+ development workflow commands
- Add GitHub issue templates (bug, feature, security) and PR template
- Update dependencies for production, development, and testing
- Add test utilities and alternative test runner for compatibility
- Include comprehensive documentation and setup guides

Features:
- Code quality: Black, isort, flake8, pylint, mypy, bandit
- Security: Vulnerability scanning, secret detection, CodeQL analysis
- Testing: pytest, coverage reporting, async support, multi-version matrix
- Automation: pre-commit hooks, automated releases, dependency updates
- Deployment: staging and production environments with approval gates
- Monitoring: build status, coverage tracking, security alerts"
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

Each commit message follows this structure:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types used:**
- `feat`: New features or major additions
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `ci`: CI/CD configuration changes
- `build`: Build system changes
- `test`: Test additions or modifications

**Benefits of this approach:**
- ✅ Clear, descriptive commit messages
- ✅ Follows conventional commit standards
- ✅ Enables automated changelog generation
- ✅ Helps with semantic versioning
- ✅ Makes git history readable and meaningful

## Recommended Execution

Choose one of these approaches:

1. **Granular commits** (recommended for team environments):
   Execute commits 1-9 in sequence for detailed history

2. **Single comprehensive commit** (for personal projects):
   Use the single commit approach for simplicity

Both approaches will result in a clean, professional git history that clearly documents the CI/CD pipeline implementation.
